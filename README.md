# WepyAnalysis

WepyAnalysis is a modular toolkit for analyzing data generated from Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulations using the Wepy framework.

The codebase is organized into five main components:
- `featurization/`: Tools for extracting structural features from WE data
- `dataset/`: Code for generating datasets from WE data
- `msm/`: Building Markov State Models and performing kinetic analysis
- `example/`: Example scripts for running simulations with Wepy and building MSMs

This repository is under active development and intended for researchers working with WE data, especially those using the Wepy framework.
